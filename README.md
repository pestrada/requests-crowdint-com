#Crowd-Requests

###[http://requests.crowdint.com](http://requests.crowdint.com/)

**Crowd-requests** is a web application created to give valuable feedback about the flaws, problems and things that could improve here @ **CrowdInt** so we can fix them.

Any member of the **CrowdInt** team can use the application and leave a **request** about what he/she would like to see or change in the working environment (could be anything!).
